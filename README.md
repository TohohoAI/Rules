# Rules
The Rules created for the 東方Project AI server.

The rules are here to foster a good community while trying to be transparent about our moderation policies.

1) Follow Discord's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.
2) Be respectful and friendly to other members. We want the server to be as welcoming as possible!
3) Do not post sexually explicit material including (but not limited to):

     a) Nudity for erotic or non-erotic purposes, 
  
     b) Hardcore and softcore sex, 
  
     c) Guro and/or excessive violence, 
  
     d) Suggestive poses or expressions (e.g., ahego)
  
     e) For other things we consider sexually explicit, or otherwise inappropriate, refer to our "Further Reading" section.
  
4) Do not spam or flood the server. Also please do not advertise closed sourced paid services. We are an open source community and anything closed source and licensed goes against our ethos.
5) Please keep discussions primarily in English.

# Further Reading
As there is no way to have all the rules prepared from the get go, this section will serve as an expansion of point 3e.

The following are not allowed:

#### Images that are meant to offend beliefs of a specific group
###### Shocking imagery relating to religion / race / nationality.

#### Images that focus on a particular fetishized body part
###### Ass focus shots, cameltoes.

#### Overly revealing clothing



# MODERATOR GUIDELINES 
Current moderator guidelines. These are guidelines for mods, a cheatsheet if you will.
These guidelines don't mean that you'll only get a warning for harassment or that you'll get banned for accidentally posting something that's more risque than it should be.
Context matters, and we give out harsher or less harsh punishments depending on it.
  -  hatespeech (1st offense) - timeout
  -  hatespeech (2nd offense) - ban
  -  posting NSFW (1st offense) - deletion and warning
  -  posting NSFW (2nd offense) - 1 day timeout
  -  posting NSFW (3rd offense) - ban
  -  posting NSFW loli/shota - ban
  -  spamming (1st offense) - deletion and warning
  -  spamming (2nd offense) - 10 minute timeout
  -  spamming (3rd offense) - 1 day timeout
  -  spamming (4+ offense) - 1 week timeout
  -  harassment (1rst offense) - deletion and warning
  -  harassment (2nd offense) - 10 minute time out
  -  harassment (3rd offense) - 1 week time out
  -  harassment (4th offense) - ban

If you wish to discuss any of these rules or propose changes, the #suggestions channel in user support would be a good place for that.

If you wish to dispute a punishment, behavior of a mod or anything like that - please open a ticket in the discord server.

You're obviously also free to use any github features on this repository such as issues and PRs.
